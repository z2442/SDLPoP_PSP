After the prince falls in to the wall, no glitched room should appear.
To pass the test: #define FIX_ENTERING_GLITCHED_ROOMS in config.h

The same #define fixes another similar glitch as well:
When the prince dies behind a wall, and he is revived with R, he appears in a glitched room. (Example: The bottom right room of level 3.)
